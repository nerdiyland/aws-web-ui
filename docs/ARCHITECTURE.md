# Architecture Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AWS Web UI infrastructure architecture, component interactions, and system design patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

The AWS Web UI infrastructure follows a modern, secure, and scalable architecture pattern using AWS managed services. The system is designed to deliver web applications with high performance, global distribution, and robust security controls.

### High-Level Architecture

**AI Image Generation Prompt for Architecture Diagram:**
```
Create a professional AWS architecture diagram with vibrant colors showing a secure web UI infrastructure. Use bright blues for AWS services, orange for data flow, and green for security components. The diagram should include:

- A colorful "Users/Browsers" icon (multiple people with devices) on the left in bright teal
- A large, prominent "Amazon CloudFront" logo/box in AWS orange in the center
- Two S3 bucket icons in AWS green: "Website Bucket" and "Login Bucket" 
- "Origin Access Identity" shield icon in gold between CloudFront and S3
- "Trusted Key Groups" security badge in purple
- "SSL Certificate" padlock icon in red
- Arrows showing data flow in bright blue with clear directional indicators
- All text labels must be clearly readable in bold, dark fonts
- Background should be light gray with subtle AWS cloud patterns
- Include the title "AWS Web UI Architecture" at the top in large, bold letters
- Add AWS logo watermark in bottom right corner
- Use modern, flat design style with rounded corners and drop shadows
```

## üè¢ Core Components

### 1. CDK Application Structure

#### Main Stack (`NerdiylandWebUi`)
```typescript
// Entry point orchestrating the entire infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stack Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WebUI Construct Integration  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Parameter Management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Output Generation
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Centralizes infrastructure configuration
- Manages stack-level properties and dependencies
- Provides consistent naming and tagging
- Coordinates resource creation across constructs

#### WebUI Construct (`WebUI`)
```typescript
// Core infrastructure construct
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ S3 Bucket Management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CloudFront Distribution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cache Policy Management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DNS and Certificate Setup
```

**Design Patterns:**
- **Construct Pattern**: Encapsulates related AWS resources
- **Configuration Pattern**: Externalized parameters for flexibility
- **Security-First Pattern**: Default secure configurations
- **Output Pattern**: Exposes important resource identifiers

### 2. Storage Layer (Amazon S3)

#### Website Bucket
- **Purpose**: Primary storage for web application files
- **Access Control**: Private bucket with OAI access only
- **Content Types**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, assets
- **Lifecycle**: Managed by CDK with configurable removal policy

#### Login Bucket (External)
- **Purpose**: Centralized authentication page storage
- **Shared Resource**: Used across multiple applications
- **Content Types**: Authentication HTML pages and related assets
- **Security**: Same OAI access pattern as website bucket

```typescript
// S3 Configuration Pattern
Bucket Security Model:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Private by default
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Origin Access Identity access
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Resource-based policies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Encryption at rest (default)
```

### 3. Content Delivery Network (Amazon CloudFront)

#### Distribution Configuration
- **Global Edge Locations**: Low-latency content delivery
- **Custom Cache Behaviors**: Optimized for different content types
- **Security Headers**: Automatic HTTPS enforcement
- **Error Handling**: SPA-friendly error responses

#### Cache Behavior Hierarchy
```
Priority Order:
1. /login.html (Login bucket, 5min cache)
2. /apps-login.html (Login bucket, 5min cache)
3. /eth-login.html (Login bucket, 5min cache)
4. /idpresponse.html (Login bucket, 5min cache)
5. /apps-idpresponse.html (Login bucket, 5min cache)
6. /favicon.png (Website bucket, 5min cache)
7. /logo.png (Website bucket, 5min cache)
8. /css/* (Website bucket, long cache, signed)
9. /css/chunk-vendors* (Website bucket, long cache, public)
10. /js/* (Website bucket, long cache, signed)
11. /js/chunk-vendors* (Website bucket, long cache, public)
12. /assets/* (Website bucket, long cache, signed)
13. Default behavior (Website bucket, 5min cache, signed)
```

### 4. Security Layer

#### Origin Access Identity (OAI)
- **Function**: Secures S3 bucket access through CloudFront only
- **Implementation**: Canonical user principal with specific permissions
- **Scope**: Both website and login buckets
- **Benefits**: Prevents direct S3 access, maintains content privacy

#### Trusted Key Groups
- **Purpose**: Implements signed URL authentication
- **Components**: Public key infrastructure for content verification
- **Scope**: Protects application content (excludes vendor files)
- **Flexibility**: Supports key rotation and multiple keys

#### SSL/TLS Implementation
- **Certificate Source**: AWS Certificate Manager
- **Enforcement**: Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- **Protocols**: TLS 1.2+ only
- **Validation**: Domain validation required

## üîÑ Data Flow Patterns
